# The Multi-Host Redirector #

The Multi-Host redirector was originally designed as a method of redirecting the old WordPress URLs to this site to maintain rankings. I wanted a product that would allow multiple sites and URLs either complete or compiled from host and path elements to be redirected.

The Multi-Host Redirector achieves all of this and can be run either in it's own site (recommended configuration) or within an existing site.

The Multi-Host Redirector will support multiple configuration types. Currently *.config XML configuration is the only configuration type supported. Feel free to raise issues for alternative configuration types that may suit your needs.

## Usage and Sample Configurations ##

The following samples are included in the source code...
